This PLSQL package allows application to pack multiple values in a single Oracle database columns. 

This package implements functionality similar to that offered by MariaDB (https://mariadb.com/kb/en/dynamic-columns/): "Dynamic columns allows one to store different sets of columns for each row in a table. It works by storing a set of columns in a blob and having a small set of functions to manipulate it. Dynamic columns should be used when it is not possible to use regular columns. A typical use case is when one needs to store items that may have many different attributes (like size, color, weight, etc), and the set of possible attributes is very large and/or unknown in advance. In that case, attributes can be put into dynamic columns."
